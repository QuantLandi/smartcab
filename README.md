# Brief description
The purpose of this project is to apply reinforcement learning to build a
simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involves modeling a complex
control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to
automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

# Software and libraries
- python 2.7
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- mpl_toolkits
- pygame (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

# How to clone and run the project
```sh

```

Make sure you are in the top-level project directory smartcab/ (that contains
this README). Then run: 

```sh
python smartcab/learned_agent.py
```
